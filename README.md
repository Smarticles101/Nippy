# Nippy
Nippy aims to be a fast, lightweight, and simple IRC client written in Java.

# About
Nippy is currently maintained by Smarticles101, a 16 year-old high school student. I created Nippy because I wanted to learn about sockets and threads in Java, while creating a application with a practical purpose.

# How to use
Nippy is currently in early experimental alpha stages where there is very basic and limited functionallity.  In order to use Nippy, download Nippy.java and Connection.java, compile them, and then launch Nippy.  You will automatically be connected to freenode irc.  From there, you can change your nick with /nick, join channels with /channel join, and switch channels with /channel switch
